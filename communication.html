                  <h3>Internet</h3>
                  <p>The internet provides effective and almost instant communication by enabling us to connect world-wide through the use of email services and instant messaging.</p>
                  <p>The internet allows us to access a wealth of information available at the press of a button. It's safe to say that the internet has clearly impacted education in a positive manner at all stages of education.</p>
                  <p>The way we interact with friends and family has also been changed by the internet. It's now possible to remain in contact with people on the other side of the planet, and talk to them as if they are stood right in front of you.</p>

                  <h3>Networking</h3>
                  <p>We can connect computers together in a network, which brings several advantages:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>File sharing - we can send files to other computers on the network</li>
                    <li>Communication - users on the network can communicate via calling, emailing, etc</li>
                    <li>Collaboration - It is possible for users on a shared network to work on the same documents together</li>
                    <li>The internet is an example of a large network that connects devices all across the globe</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                  <h3>Data Transmission</h3>
                  <p>Data transfer occurs through data packets being transmitted over a network connection. Data can be stored online in servers and databases which other devices can access at any time.</p>
                  <p>Content delivery networks are an example of a networks that provide a high availability to data stored in data centers and accessible online.</p>
                  <p>Another example of a way we can use technology to communicate is through the use of services such as AirDrop. AirDrop allows two devices to transfer files by means of close-range wireless communication. It is an easy-to-use and convenient way of communicating between two devices.</p>
